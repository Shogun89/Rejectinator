# Rejectinator #

This is a small program I created in a few hours. It uses the [NLTK package](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html) to take a writing sample (here rejection letter templates) and tokenize it, then finds synonyms for a random sample of the words and replace them for mostly comical effect.
